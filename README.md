Build your own Smart Rain Detector using Arduino Uno/Arduino Ek R4, a rain sensor module, and a servo motor! In this beginner-friendly project, we detect rain in real time and trigger an automatic servo action â€” perfect for DIY automation, weather-based systems, and learning about sensors + actuators.
